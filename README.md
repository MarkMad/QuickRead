# Quick Read
=======

QuickRead is an app that allows you to read quickly without moving your eyes. With QuickRead you can read 5 times faster than you normally would. It allows you to share content from other applications, like web browsers or news readers.
The technique is called [Rapid Serial Visual Representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Serial_Visual_Presentation).
It is based on the [Jetzt browser extension](https://github.com/ds300/jetzt), which is itself inspired on [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/).
